**this**

**this** is a runtime binding. It is not a binding defined at the time it was written.

In other words, **this** is completely contextual and based on the conditions of the functions invocation.

**this** is not a reference to the containing function. It is also not a reference to the functions lexical scope.

Again, **this** is a binding that is created when a function is invoked. What **this** references is determined by the **call-site** where the function is called.
